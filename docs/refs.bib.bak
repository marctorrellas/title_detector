  abstract = {For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and
	misclassification costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated
	estimates of the posterior probability. Isotonic calibration is a
	powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to overfitting
	on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic
	curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for
	normally distributed per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally
	that many classifiers including Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from
	a particular distortion where these score distributions are heavily
	skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability
	estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the
	logistic curve family does not include the identity function, and
	hence logistic calibration can easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated
	classifier. In this paper we solve all these problems with a richer
	class of calibration maps based on the beta distribution. We derive
	the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy
	as fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta
	calibration is superior to logistic calibration for Naive Bayes and
	Adaboost. },
